# Iskra Assignment

In this task I am asked to create a search input that displays suggestions as the user types (done with a fake API).

The styling is done with SASS.

Also, I have implemented local storage to save and display the last 10 searches. 

User can click on suggestions as well as last 10 searches to search the specific term again.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

There is one test to check if the form correctly submits.
